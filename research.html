        <h2>Research</h2>
        During my student years, I have specialized in <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> and <b>Data Science</b>. My current research lies within the <b>AI4SE</b> framework,
        that is, leveraging AI for software quality and testing.<br /><br />

        I am currently working on testing <b>Smart Human-centric Ecosystems (SHEs)</b>. <b>SHEs</b> are multifaceted systems that emerge from the composition of
        independently-operated and autonomous systems with smart functionalities and that evolve over time. 
        My goal is to develop a framework for predicting, identifying, and preventing failures in <b>SHEs</b>.
