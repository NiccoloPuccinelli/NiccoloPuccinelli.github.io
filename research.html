        <h2>Research</h2>
        During my student years, I have specialized in <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> and <b>Data Science</b>. My current research lies within the <b>AI4SE</b> framework,
        that is, leveraging AI for software quality and testing.<br /><br />

        The project I am currently working on is about testing <b>Smart Human-centric EcoSystems (SHcES)</b>. <b>SHcES</b> are multifaceted systems that emerge from the composition of
        independently-operated and autonomous systems with smart functionalities and that evolve over time. 
        The project aims to develop a framework for predicting, identifying, and preventing failures in <b>SHcES</b>.
