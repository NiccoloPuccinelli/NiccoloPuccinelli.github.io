abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of software engineering, the integration of AI into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) heralds a transformative era for developers. Recently, we have assisted to a pivotal shift toward AI-assisted programming, exemplified by tools like GitHub Copilot and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which have become a crucial element for coding, debugging, and software design. In this article, we provide a comparative analysis between the current state of AI-assisted programming in 2024 and our projections for 2030, by exploring how AI advancements are set to enhance the implementation phase, fundamentally altering developers’ roles from manual coders to orchestrators of AI-driven development ecosystems. We envision HyperAssistant, an augmented AI tool that offers comprehensive support to 2030 developers, addressing current limitations in mental health support, fault detection, code optimization, team interaction, and skill development. We emphasize AI as a complementary force, augmenting developers’ capabilities rather than replacing them, leading to the creation of sophisticated, reliable, and secure software solutions. Our vision seeks to anticipate the evolution of programming practices, challenges, and future directions, shaping a new paradigm where developers and AI collaborate more closely, promising a significant leap in SE efficiency, security, and creativity.},
